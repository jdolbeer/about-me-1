        <h4 id="careerSummary">Career Summary</h4>
          <p id="careerSummaryPara">While working directly for two experienced Hollywood Directors and Producers: David Zucker (Airplane) and Michael Peyser (former Chief of Disney Hollywood Studios), I have been able to connect the dots between the development process and the distribution process. In the graduate program at USC School of Cinematic Arts I learned everything from AVID editing to feature and episodic writing and script analysis. I have gained practical experience in the five phases of media production: Development, Pre-Pro, Production, Post-Pro, and Distribution. My work experience has given me the chance to do everything from writing a feature length screenplay, negotiating box office bonuses with agents, and post supervising film festival deliverables.
